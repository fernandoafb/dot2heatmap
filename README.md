# dot2heatmap

This tool translates dot diagrams into Latex files and then calls pdflatex to output them in PDF format.

Historical note: this small (and ugly) project helped me a lot back in 2011 to make the diagrams for academic articles of my Master's thesis. There is a lot of improvements (Maven, Java 8, JCommander, etc.) which can be made, I was a much more Java noob back then, but I don't intend on improving this in the near future.

It used to be hosted in Google Code: code.google.com/p/dot2heatmap, and it was initially automatically imported to github.
